## JAVA EXAMPLES ##

### Purpose ###
This project was created as my personal playground / sandbox to practice on basic data structures, algorithms and other basic programming challenges using Java as the primary development language.

Again, this was really designed as a personal practice arena to prepare for interviewing in the new (2024 onward) technical job market.  Feel free to use what you want to, but rather than simply copying elements from this, make sure you understand what I did, and be able to talk through what each line of code is doing within the particular methods.

I'd ask that if you do choose to use any of this, feel free to fork this repository, as I won't be approving any PRs from any 3rd parties for the time being.

### Requirements ###
To run this, you'll need the following:
* Java 17.0.x or higher
* Maven 3.x

Of note, the Maven dependencies are going to be changing as I add in new functionality for more advanced functionality (e.g. mocking frameworks, GCP or AWS SDKs, etc.).  I'd encourage you (if interested) to watch this repository to see some of the more advanced features that I will be incorporating.  Feel free to comment or ask questions.  My details are contained in the POM file if you would like to reach out.
